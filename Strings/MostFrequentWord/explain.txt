Most Frequent Word Problem Explaination
=========================================

Problem Statement:
Given a paragraph of text, we want to find out which word appears most often. We should ignore punctuation and case differences (e.g., "Dog" and "dog" are the same).

How it works:
1. We take the input text and clean it up (lowercase it, remove symbols).
2. We break the text into a list of individual words.
3. We count how many times each word appears.
4. We return the winner!

Example:
Input: "Apple apple, orange."
1. Clean: "apple apple orange"
2. Split: ["apple", "apple", "orange"]
3. Count: apple=2, orange=1
4. Result: ("apple", 2)
